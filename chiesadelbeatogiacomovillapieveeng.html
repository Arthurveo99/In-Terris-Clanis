<h2>A Place of Memory, Faith, and Popular Identity</h2>

<p>The Church of Blessed Giacomo Villa is one of the most profound expressions of popular devotion in Città della Pieve. It stands just a few steps from the southern city walls, in a secluded yet symbolically powerful location—linked to the most dramatic moment of the blessed's life: his violent death and the miracle that is said to have indicated the place of his burial.</p>

<h2>Who Was Blessed Giacomo Villa?</h2>

<p>Giacomo Villa was born around 1270 in Città della Pieve to a wealthy family. After studying civil and canon law in Siena, he chose a life devoted to serving the poor and the sick, inspired by the spirit of the <strong>Servants of Mary</strong> and the Franciscan ideals of poverty.</p>

<p>He returned to his hometown, where he personally restored a small hospital near Porta Vecciano (today Porta Fiorentina), transforming it into a place of free care and shelter for the needy, refusing any personal privilege.</p>

<p>Due to his independent activity and his efforts to remove the hospital from the control of the bishop of Chiusi, Giacomo came into conflict with the ecclesiastical authorities. According to tradition, he was assassinated in 1304 on the bishop’s orders, while walking to Rome to defend his cause.</p>

<h2>The Miracle of the Oxen and the Chosen Site</h2>

<p>After his death, the townspeople wished to bring his remains back to Città della Pieve on a cart pulled by oxen. The best-known account tells that, upon reaching the area near Porta Romana, the oxen stopped and refused to move forward. Interpreted as a divine sign, this event indicated the exact location where the church now stands, built as a vow of the people.</p>

<h2>Construction History of the Church</h2>

<p>The church was built between the late 17th and early 18th century in a sober yet elegant Baroque style. The architectural layout is <strong>elliptical</strong>, with a semicircular apse and a low dome—typical features of devotional churches in central Italy. The simple and harmonious façade features a sandstone portal and a small central rose window.</p>

<p>Inside, the atmosphere is intimate and reflective. The <strong>reliquary urn</strong> of the blessed is preserved on the main altar: a glass case containing a wax effigy reproducing his likeness, within which his mortal remains are kept.</p>

<h2>Artworks and Interior Decoration</h2>

<p>The church houses several fine works of art:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>17th-century canvas</strong> depicting the <em>Virgin in Glory among Saints</em>, attributed to Il Pomarancio (Niccolò Circignani), an artist originally from Città della Pieve.</li>
  <li>Two stucco statues of Servite saints, placed on either side of the presbytery.</li>
  <li>A bas-relief bearing the Marian star, symbol of the blessed and his spiritual vocation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Feast of Blessed Giacomo Villa</h2>

<p>Each year on January 15th, Città della Pieve solemnly celebrates the <strong>dies natalis</strong> (heavenly birth) of Blessed Giacomo Villa. The most evocative moment is the <strong>reenactment of the relic translation</strong>: the urn is carried in procession through the streets of the city on a symbolic ox-drawn cart, accompanied by clergy, confraternities, and townspeople.</p>

<p>The celebration includes a solemn Mass, nighttime torchlight processions, moments of prayer, and, in some years, cultural events and performances that recount the life of the blessed through theater and sacred music.</p>

<h2>Spirituality and Local Identity</h2>

<p>The figure of Blessed Giacomo Villa is deeply rooted in the collective memory of Città della Pieve. He is considered the <strong>patron of charity and protector of the poor</strong>, and his name is still invoked in times of hardship. Many locals remember him as a symbol of integrity and justice against abuse of power.</p>

<p>The church is also a pilgrimage site for the faithful from Umbria and Tuscany, and is included in several religious itineraries dedicated to saints and blesseds of the Upper Val di Chiana.</p>
