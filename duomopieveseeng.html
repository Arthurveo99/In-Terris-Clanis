<h2>Co-Cathedral of Saints Gervasius and Protasius</h2>

<p>In the heart of Città della Pieve, overlooking Piazza Plebiscito, stands the Co-Cathedral of Saints Gervasius and Protasius, commonly known as the Duomo. This sacred building is not only the center of religious life in the city, but also a treasure chest of layered art and memory, telling a story that spans over 1,500 years. Its architectural and decorative evolution reflects the gradual transition from ancient to modern, from medieval sacred art to the full expression of Baroque, passing through the Umbrian Renaissance.</p>

<h2>Origins: From Antiquity to Romanesque</h2>

<p>The foundations of the Duomo rest on land that was already inhabited during Etruscan and then Roman times. Several archaeological remains—including walls in <em>opus reticulatum</em> and stretches of pavement—indicate the presence of preexisting Roman civil structures. It is possible that a <em>domus</em>, a public building, or even a small pagan temple once stood here. The site was Christianized in the 4th century, when the first paleo-Christian church was built, dedicated to Saints Gervasius and Protasius, two Milanese martyrs who were widely venerated throughout central Italy.</p>

<p>During the early Middle Ages (8th–9th century), the church was expanded in Romanesque style: a basilica with three naves, a trussed wooden roof, and sandstone walls. Despite later renovations, some Romanesque masonry is still visible in the lower parts of the structure and around the apse.</p>

<h2>Transformations from Gothic to Baroque</h2>

<p>In the 13th century, during the communal era, the building underwent a major intervention in Gothic style, particularly affecting the choir area. However, the current appearance is the result of radical renovations carried out between the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

<p>Starting in 1584, under the initiative of Bishop Fabio della Corgna, a complete reconstruction of the building was undertaken according to the architectural principles of the Counter-Reformation: a Latin cross layout, a wide and luminous single nave, and side chapels with altars dedicated to confraternities and noble families. In the 17th century, a dome was built and the interior was richly decorated in Baroque style, with stuccoes, gilded frames, and large altarpieces.</p>

<h2>A Living Museum: Painting, Sculpture, and Faith</h2>

<h3>Pietro Vannucci, known as Il Perugino</h3>

<p>The greatest figure of Umbrian Renaissance painting, he was born in Città della Pieve around 1450. Two of his works dominate the cathedral’s naves:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Baptism of Christ</strong> (c. 1510): located in the right nave, a scene of great compositional balance and spiritual intensity.</li>
  <li><strong>The Madonna in Glory with Saints Gervasius and Protasius</strong> (1514): an altarpiece in the apse, with a golden sky and powerful symbolic charge.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Antonio Circignani, known as Il Pomarancio</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Marriage of the Virgin</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Our Lady of Mount Carmel</strong> (1620), remarkable for its emotional intensity and theatrical style.</li>
  <li><strong>Heavenly Glory</strong> (1598): a large apse fresco, now partially lost.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Artists</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Domenico Alfani</strong> (1521): Madonna with Child among angels and saints.</li>
  <li><strong>Giannicola di Paolo</strong>: Madonna among Saints.</li>
  <li><strong>Salvio Savini</strong>: Madonna Enthroned with Saints (late 16th century).</li>
  <li><strong>Wooden Crucifix</strong> attributed to <strong>Giambologna</strong> (1550): a work of high sculptural quality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Religious Role</h2>

<p>The Duomo of Città della Pieve serves as a co-cathedral of the Diocese of Perugia–Città della Pieve. It shares the cathedral title with the Cathedral of San Lorenzo in Perugia. It hosts the city’s main religious celebrations, including Holy Week and Corpus Christi.</p>

<h2>Location and Urban Context</h2>

<p>The Duomo overlooks Piazza Plebiscito, the central hub of civic and religious life. It stands at the highest point of the historic center, with views toward Lake Trasimeno. Surrounding the square are the Palazzo della Corgna, the Oratory of the Bianchi, and the cathedral bell tower—converted from an ancient Etruscan tower during the Renaissance.</p>

<h2>The Cathedral Museum</h2>

<p>Inside the Duomo is a small Diocesan Museum that houses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ancient liturgical vestments</li>
  <li>Silver and brass reliquaries</li>
  <li>Illuminated medieval manuscripts</li>
  <li>Altarpieces and devotional paintings</li>
  <li>Ex-voto offerings and sacred furnishings</li>
</ul>
