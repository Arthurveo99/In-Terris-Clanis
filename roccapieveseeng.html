<h2>A Military Stronghold in the Heart of Medieval Umbria</h2>
<p>The Rocca Perugina of Città della Pieve is a rare example of Umbrian medieval military architecture and a significant witness to the political history between Perugia and its subject territories. It was built in 1326 by order of the city of Perugia, with the goal of maintaining control over Castel della Pieve—a town often rebellious and disputed between Perugia, Orvieto, and the Papal States.</p>
<p>Although formally part of the Papal States, Perugia in the 14th century exercised strong political and military autonomy, going so far as to assert its authority over nearby territories like Castel della Pieve through the construction of fortresses and fortified outposts. The decision to build a fortress was no coincidence: the Pieve area, though under Perugian influence, was known for the rebelliousness of its inhabitants. The city government sent Ambrogio and Lorenzo Maitani—renowned Sienese architects (Lorenzo was the master builder of the Orvieto Cathedral)—to create a structure capable of dominating and, if needed, militarily suppressing any uprisings.</p>

<h2>Structure and Architecture</h2>
<p>The fortress was built adjacent to the city walls, near Porta Perugina, a strategic access point to the town and the ancient road connecting Pieve to Perugia.</p>
<p>The original building had five square-based battlemented towers, all connected by curtain walls. The towers provided wide views over the Val di Chiana and toward Perugia. According to ancient sources, they were equipped to send fire signals in case of danger.</p>
<p>The Rocca was also surrounded by a deep moat (now filled in) and an open glacis free of buildings, to prevent enemy cover and allow defense against attacks. Inside were quarters for soldiers, food stores, and command rooms.</p>

<h2>Symbol of Perugian Domination</h2>
<p>More than just a defensive structure, the Rocca was a visual symbol of Perugia’s power. Built in stone and brick, with solid and austere forms, it was meant to inspire respect and submission. Its placement at the edge of the village, near the main entrance, made it a political sentinel even before a military one.</p>

<h2>From Prison to Executions: Tragic Episodes</h2>
<p>Over the centuries, the Rocca also served as a prison and, on occasion, a site for executions. One of the most well-known events occurred in January 1503, when two members of the Orsini family, Paolo and Francesco, were imprisoned in the Rocca and later murdered by order of Cesare Borgia, following the betrayals of the Senigallia massacre. This episode is also cited by Niccolò Machiavelli in *The Prince* as an example of cunning and political cruelty.</p>

<h2>The Fortress Today: Remains, Restorations, and Panoramic Views</h2>
<p>Today, parts of the original structure remain, especially three of the five towers (two of which are truncated). The complex is visible from Piazza Matteotti, in the town center, and has undergone restoration efforts that enhanced the original stonework and improved accessibility.</p>
<p>Although not entirely open to the public, the area offers exceptional panoramic views over the Umbrian countryside and the Sienese Valdichiana. Some rooms are now used for temporary exhibitions, art shows, and historical reenactments. The Rocca is part of the civic museum network and is occasionally open for cultural events.</p>

<h2>A Legacy of Stone</h2>
<p>The Rocca Perugina is not just a defensive construction of the past: it is a living testimony to the connection between architecture and power, between physical structures and political dynamics. To observe it today is to read, carved in stone, the tensions and ambitions of a turbulent and intricate Middle Ages.</p>
