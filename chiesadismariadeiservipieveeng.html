<h2>Origins: The Arrival of the Servites in Citt√† della Pieve</h2>

<p>The Church of Santa Maria dei Servi originates from the presence of the <strong>Order of the Servants of Mary</strong> (also known as "Servites") in Citt√† della Pieve, documented as early as the second half of the 13th century. The Servites were a mendicant order founded in Florence around 1233, devoted to Marian worship, preaching, and charity. Their arrival in the town reflects the broader spread of mendicant orders in Umbria, where they were welcomed by both urban communities and local lords.</p>

<p>The church was likely built between 1260 and 1270, shortly after the Servite convent was established. It was originally dedicated to the <strong>Madonna della Stella</strong>, one of the oldest titles with which the order venerated the Virgin Mary. Its location was strategic: just outside Porta Romana, along a main access road to the city, in a then-peripheral but expanding area.</p>

<h2>From the Middle Ages to the Renaissance: Expansions and Early Works</h2>

<p>The original structure, in Umbrian Gothic style, featured a single nave with pointed arches and a wooden trussed roof. During the 14th and 15th centuries, various interventions were carried out, including the addition of side chapels and the rearrangement of the apse. The church became increasingly important in the city's religious life, serving as the seat of confraternities and a Marian pilgrimage site.</p>

<p>In 1517, the <strong>Compagnia della Stella</strong>‚Äîa local confraternity‚Äîcommissioned Pietro Vannucci, known as <strong>Il Perugino</strong>, to paint the famous <em>Deposition from the Cross</em>, which would adorn the main altar for centuries. The work was created in the master's final years and is considered one of his last and most moving creations.</p>

<h2>Baroque Era: Stylistic Transformation and the High Altar</h2>

<p>In the 17th century, following the taste of the time, the church underwent significant transformation in Baroque style. The decorations were enriched with <strong>stuccoes, gilded frames, side altars, and new statues</strong>, and the interior was redefined with greater theatrical emphasis.</p>

<p>During this period, the <strong>majestic high altar</strong> was created, probably designed by Tuscan artisans. To adapt to the new structure, Perugino‚Äôs fresco was partially covered with Baroque decorations, which compromised its legibility for centuries. Some frescoes were removed and relocated, others were lost.</p>

<h2>19th Century and the New Bell Tower</h2>

<p>With the suppression of religious orders following the unification of Italy, the convent annexed to the church was closed. However, the church continued to be used for worship. In 1834, the current <strong>neoclassical bell tower</strong> was built, designed by local architect <strong>Giovanni Santini</strong>. The new bell tower, slender and elegant, harmonizes with the overall structure and has become one of its distinguishing elements.</p>

<h2>20th Century and the Rediscovery of Perugino</h2>

<p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, with the rediscovery of Renaissance art and renewed interest in Perugino's work, restorations and studies were launched to recover the ancient Deposition fresco. The cleaning and consolidation works revealed much of the original composition, despite severe damage.</p>

<p>The valorization of the church as a historical and artistic heritage eventually led to its transformation into a <strong>civic and diocesan museum</strong>. In 2009, thanks to a partnership between the Diocese, the Municipality, and Sistema Museo, the church was officially inaugurated as a museum, with thematic exhibitions dedicated to Marian devotion, the history of the Servites, and Perugino‚Äôs work.</p>

<h2>Today: The Church as a Museum and Place of Memory</h2>

<p>Today, the former Church of Santa Maria dei Servi is one of the <strong>most important cultural centers in Citt√† della Pieve</strong>. In addition to the Perugino fresco, it houses Baroque stucco statues of blessed Servite figures, a precious <strong>17th-century wooden choir</strong>, and highly valuable liturgical furnishings. The building itself is an architectural record of changing styles and devotions over seven centuries of local history.</p>

<p>The church continues to welcome visitors, scholars, and pilgrims, offering an authentic immersion in the spiritual, artistic, and urban history of Citt√† della Pieve.</p>

<h2>üìç Getting There and Location</h2>

<p>The church is located at <strong>Via Beato Giacomo Villa, 5</strong>, just outside <strong>Porta Romana</strong>, one of the main entrances to the historic center. It‚Äôs a 5-minute walk from Piazza del Duomo or the town center. Free parking is available near the southern gate.</p>

<p>The museum entrance is up a small slope and clearly marked with brown information panels. The area is quiet and shaded, perfect for summer visits.</p>

<h2>üïí Visiting Hours</h2>

<p>The Church of Santa Maria dei Servi now hosts the <strong>Civic and Diocesan Museum</strong> and is accessible only with a guided tour. It is part of the <em>"Urban Trekking through the Places of Perugino"</em>, a guided itinerary touching the city‚Äôs key artistic landmarks.</p>

  <li>Anti-slip terracotta flooring</li>

<h2>üì∏ Photography and Reflection Tips</h2>

<p>The natural light filtering through the slit windows casts warm, evocative reflections on the terracotta and wood. The best time for photography is between 10:00 and 11:30 AM, or in the late afternoon. The interior is intimate and quiet: respectful attire and behavior are recommended, even though the site is no longer consecrated.</p>
